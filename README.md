###Current Version: 1.0
<i>Instant stats for your League of Legends team lobby before you load in game, just a few clicks away.</i>

LoLQuickStats is faster than any other tool for looking up complete team stats with champion-specific information. It retrieves summoner names and selected champions from a League of Legends lobby screenshot and quickly looks your team's ranked winrates, champion-specific winrates, and mastery levels. It also collects your team's average rank tier, average total ranked win/loss ratio, and average champion win/loss ratio -- **before you load into the game.**

#Instructions
* Have LoLQuickStats open and use  `alt + printscreen` to capture your current game lobby to the clipboard once all summoners have locked or hovered their champions.
* Press Import Clipboard to load the screenshot into LoLQuickStats.
* Edit the summoner names and champions as your team locks in (or screenshot after everyone has locked in) as needed.
* Fetch data to see instant stats on each team member with the champion they're playing.
* Other league tools are linked for quick in-depth information about each summoner and champion.   
 * Click a summoner's rank tier icon to open their [op.gg](http://op.gg) profile.
 * Click a champ splash for the champion's [champion.gg](http://champion.gg) page.
 * Click a summoner's mastery level icon to open their [mastery points](https://www.masterypoints.com/) profile.
