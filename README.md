<i>Instant stats for your League of Legends team lobby, just a few clicks away.</i>

Using Google's Tesseract OCR Enjine and image comparing, ShouldIDodge pulls summoner names and selected champions from a League of Legends lobby screenshot. Using [Riot-API-Java](https://github.com/rithms/riot-api-java), you can quickly look up your team's winrates, mastery levels, and more for the champion they're playing.
#Instructions
- Use  `ctrl + printscreen` to capture your current game lobby to the clipboard at any point and load it into ShouldIDodge.
- Edit the summoner names and champions as your team locks in (or screenshot after everyone has locked in)
- Fetch data to see instant stats on each team member with the champion they're playing.
